  "goal": "# Pricing and Product Coverage Roadmap\n\nThis file turns the product and model expansion roadmap into trackable milestones\nwith measurable acceptance criteria. Update statuses as work lands.\n\n## How to use\n- Keep phases in order; update status and checkboxes as items complete.\n- Tie acceptance criteria to tests and report outputs whenever possible.\n- See `docs/success_metrics.md` for thresholds and reporting targets.\n\n## Current baseline (implemented)\n- Products: spot, forwards, equity swaps, European and American options, barriers,\n  digitals, Asians, lookbacks, cliquets, corridors, variance swaps, vol swaps,\n  basket proxy.\n- Models: Black-Scholes, Heston, Merton, local vol (placeholder), local-stochastic\n  vol (leverage surface), hybrid LSV proxy.\n- Engines: analytic, tree, PDE, Monte Carlo (LSM for Americans, Brownian bridge,\n  variance reduction toggles, Halton QMC).\n- Risk workflow: historical VaR/ES, FRTB IMA liquidity-horizon aggregation,\n  PLA/backtesting, RTPL grid sensitivities, grid approximation/checks.\n- Reporting: JSON/CSV/HTML reports and run logs with schema metadata.\n\n## Phase 1 - Stabilize core vanilla coverage (4-6 weeks)\nStatus: complete\n\nDeliverables\n- [x] Deterministic Monte Carlo via seeded `EngineSettings`.\n- [x] Cross-engine parity tests for European options (analytic vs tree vs PDE).\n- [x] Auto Greek method: analytic for BS European options, bump fallback otherwise.\n- [x] Greek stability tests (delta/gamma/vega) against bump size halving.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- Parity test passes within abs 1e-2 or rel 1e-3 for BS European calls.\n- Deterministic Monte Carlo produces identical prices with fixed seed.\n- Bump Greek stability within 2-5 percent when bump size is halved.\n\n## Phase 2 - Barrier and digital coverage (6-8 weeks)\nStatus: complete\n\nDeliverables\n- [x] PDE or analytic pricing for standard barrier types (up/down, in/out).\n- [x] Monte Carlo continuous monitoring with Brownian bridge validation cases.\n- [x] Digital pricing parity across analytic and MC for BS.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- Barrier PDE/MC prices match analytic benchmarks (where available) within 2 percent.\n- Brownian bridge barrier price is less than or equal to discrete monitoring.\n- Digital option prices across engines within 2 percent for BS scenarios.\n\n## Phase 3 - Asian, lookback, cliquet, corridor coverage (8-10 weeks)\nStatus: in progress\n\nDeliverables\n- [x] Monte Carlo variance reduction toggles (antithetic, control variate,\n  moment matching, Halton QMC).\n- [ ] Path-dependent payoff regression tests for Asian, lookback, cliquet, corridor.\n- [ ] Monte Carlo stderr and config metadata propagated into pricing results and reports.\n- [ ] Convergence sweep utility (paths/seed grid) with report outputs.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- MC standard error shrinks roughly with 1/sqrt(N) across path products.\n- Variance reduction reduces stderr by at least 25 percent at fixed paths.\n- Pricing reports include stderr, confidence intervals, and MC configuration metadata.\n- Regression tests match analytic or benchmark prices within 2-5 percent.\n\n## Phase 4 - Volatility and variance swaps (8-12 weeks)\nStatus: in progress\n\nDeliverables\n- [x] Static replication from surface for variance swap fair strikes.\n- [x] Vol swap pricing with variance-to-vol conversion and bias checks.\n- [x] Monte Carlo realized variance/vol pricing.\n- [ ] Corridor variance swap pricing with surface integration and MC fallback.\n- [ ] Benchmark tests for variance/vol swap parity (analytic vs MC).\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- Variance swap fair strike matches analytic surface integration benchmarks.\n- MC realized variance estimates converge to analytic fair strike within 2 percent.\n- Vol swap prices are within 2-3 percent of sqrt-variance benchmarks under BS.\n\n## Phase 5 - Model expansion and calibration depth (12-16 weeks)\nStatus: in progress\n\nDeliverables\n- [x] Local-stochastic vol calibration pipeline (direct leverage + particle).\n- [ ] Calibration stability checks (parameter bounds, fit diagnostics, sanity).\n- [ ] Local vol surface bootstrapping with arbitrage checks.\n- [ ] Heston/Merton calibration to implied vol smiles.\n- [ ] Model/engine compatibility matrix with coverage notes in docs.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- LSV calibration produces stable leverage surfaces across tenors.\n- Calibration diagnostics saved with run metadata and reproducible seeds.\n- Calibration errors meet `docs/success_metrics.md` thresholds.\n\n## Phase 6 - Portfolio and risk workflow enhancements (ongoing)\nStatus: in progress\n\nDeliverables\n- [x] Standardized pricing and risk artifacts (JSON/CSV/HTML) with schema metadata.\n- [x] Grid approximation diagnostics and sensitivity check reports.\n- [ ] Scenario pricing artifacts aligned with market risk reports.\n- [ ] Stress testing library (historical + macro scenarios) with report templates.\n- [ ] Performance profiling, caching, and parallelization hooks for portfolio-scale runs.\n- [ ] Risk factor mapping and desk approval workflow wiring.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- Pricing and risk reports share consistent schema versioning.\n- Scenario pricing artifacts align with `docs/reporting.md` definitions.\n- Stress reports include scenario metadata and reproducible inputs.\n- Runtime targets meet `docs/success_metrics.md` thresholds.\n\n## Phase 7 - Market data and curve/surface industrialization (12-20 weeks)\nStatus: planned\n\nDeliverables\n- [ ] Curve bootstrapping (OIS, futures, swaps) with multi-curve support.\n- [ ] Vol surface calibration with arbitrage checks and extrapolation rules.\n- [ ] Corporate actions, calendars, and day-count conventions in market data pipeline.\n- [ ] Data quality rules, lineage tracking, and versioned snapshots.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- Bootstrap curves replicate input quotes within tolerance.\n- Surface no-arbitrage checks pass across tenors and strikes.\n- Snapshot lineage supports reproducible pricing/risk runs.\n\n## Phase 8 - Cross-asset expansion (16-24 weeks)\nStatus: planned\n\nDeliverables\n- [ ] FX, rates, credit, and commodities product libraries.\n- [ ] Multi-asset correlation and cross-risk-factor simulation.\n- [ ] Multi-curve discounting and collateralization conventions.\n- [ ] Basket and hybrid products beyond proxy approximations.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- Cross-asset parity and calibration tests pass within defined tolerances.\n- Portfolio risk aggregates across asset classes with consistent risk factors.\n\n## Phase 9 - Counterparty credit and XVA (16-24 weeks)\nStatus: planned\n\nDeliverables\n- [ ] Exposure profiles (EPE/PFE) with netting/CSA terms.\n- [ ] CVA/DVA/FVA/MVA/KVA calculations and reporting.\n- [ ] Wrong-way risk toggles and stress scenario integration.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- XVA reports reconcile against exposure profiles and market data.\n- Stress scenarios produce explainable shifts with audit trails.\n\n## Phase 10 - Productionization and governance (ongoing)\nStatus: planned\n\nDeliverables\n- [ ] Model risk governance (validation evidence, approvals, versioning).\n- [ ] Batch orchestration, distributed compute, and storage for large portfolios.\n- [ ] Monitoring, SLAs, and alerting for pricing/risk services.\n- [ ] Secure APIs, permissioning, and audit logs.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- Reproducible runs with immutable inputs and outputs.\n- Performance and availability targets meet business SLAs.",
