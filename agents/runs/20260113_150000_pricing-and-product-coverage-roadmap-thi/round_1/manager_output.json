  "next_steps": [
    "Resolve reviewer findings: centralize/report schema versioning across pricing and market risk, relax numeric metric coercion, and add CSV/HTML output assertions in tests.",
    "Implement and test path-dependent regression suite (Asian/lookback/cliquet/corridor) with deterministic benchmarks and add convergence sweep report outputs.",
    "Add corridor variance swap support and analytic vs MC parity tests per Phase 4 criteria."
  ],
  "reasons": [
    "Planner criteria require path-dependent regression tests and convergence sweep evidence; no corresponding changes or tests were delivered.",
    "Phase 4 parity and corridor variance swap criteria are not addressed in the implementation.",
    "Reviewer identified schema version mismatch risk and missing CSV/HTML output assertions, plus overly strict numeric type handling."
  ],
  "status": "fail",
  "summary": "Fails acceptance because only MC diagnostics propagation was implemented while multiple required criteria (path-dependent regression tests, convergence sweep, corridor variance swap parity, calibration diagnostics, scenario reporting alignment, runtime targets) remain unmet, and reviewer flagged schema/versioning and test coverage issues."
